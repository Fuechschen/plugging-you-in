# Plugging you in...

`plugging-you-in` is aimed to be an OOP-based client for plug.dj. It's still under development, but some basic functions are already working. You can find a jsdoc-based documentation [here](https://fuechschen.github.io/plugging-you-in/)

##### Ratelimits
To avoid bots causing issues on plug, the library only allows up to 10 requests (actions) per second. Any further action will be delayed dynamically.
